# Customer Service System using Data Structures

The Customer Service System is a console-based application developed to simulate a real-world customer service environment. The project demonstrates the practical use of *Data Structures* to manage customer requests efficiently based on service priority and order of arrival.

---

## Objective

- To manage customer service requests effectively
- To apply core Data Structures concepts in a real-life scenario
- To understand how different data structures improve system performance

---

## Key Data Structures Used

- *Queue* – To manage customers in a First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) manner
- *Priority Queue* – To handle high-priority customer issues
- *Linked List* – To store customer details dynamically
- *Stack* – To maintain service history or undo operations

---

## Features

- Add new customer service requests
- Assign priority to customer issues
- Serve customers based on priority or arrival time
- Display waiting customers
- View service history
- Remove completed requests

---

## Technologies Used

- *Programming Language:* C / C++ / Java (choose one based on your project)
- *IDE:* VS Code / Eclipse / Dev C++
- *Platform:* Console-based application

---

## System Workflow

1. Customer submits a service request
2. Request is added to the queue or priority queue
3. Service agent processes requests based on priority
4. Completed requests are stored in history
5. System updates the waiting list
